### Machine Learning & AI

#### Mix

- [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/): an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within minutes in your choice of notebook environment
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): an end-to-end open source machine learning platform
- [Keras](https://keras.io/): an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load
- [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.6/): a open source deep learning framework suited for flexible research prototyping and production.
- [Singa](https://singa.apache.org/): focusing on distributed training of deep learning and machine learning models
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

#### JavaScript
